# Information Retrieval - Assessment 1
This project was developed in the context of the subject Information Retrieval from the Integrated Master Degree in Computer and Telematics Engineering.

It was created a module for identifying the wanted labels and respective information (IdentifierReader.py), a module to make a simple tokenizer (Tokenizer.py) and then a improved one that complements the first and adds the Stemmer tokenizer (ImprovedTokenizer.py) and, finally, a module to index the terms (Indexer.py).

As it is, the software will ask to choose the file to read from. In this repository there is only the sample file and the output file is related to it.
